# LSxD
> It's like LS, but with a D 😛

A simple and naïve implementation of two unix commands ([`LS`](https://www.linux.org/docs/man1/ls.html) and [`DU`](https://www.linux.org/docs/man1/du.html)) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ❤️

## Key features
- Displays the contents of a folder (including files and directories)
- Displays the human readable size of files
- Displays the human readable size of subdirectories
- Can be recursive (using `-d` argument)
